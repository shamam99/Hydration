3. **Water Tracker**: The main screen that shows the current water intake, daily target, and visual progress.

## 🚀 Features

- **Personalized Daily Intake Goal**: Calculates daily water intake based on user’s body weight.
- **Custom Notifications**: Users can set custom reminders to keep themselves hydrated throughout the day.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays progress using an animated circular progress bar.
- **Motivational Reminders**: Sends different notifications based on the user's progress throughout the day.
